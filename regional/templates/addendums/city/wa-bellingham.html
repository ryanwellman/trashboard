  <h2>Required Addition to Monitoring Agreement</h2>

  <p>
    As you may or may not know, the Bellingham Police Department has a policy that requires
    private, third party, on-site alarm verification of all home security burglar alarm
    activations BEFORE the Bellingham Police Department will dispatch a unit to the location. You
    are obligated to comply with this Bellingham Police policy. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Under this policy when a home security burglar alarm is activated, the monitoring station must
    first call a third-party, contracted, guard service to be dispatched to the alarm location.
    The guard service will be required to check the perimeter of the property and look for signs
    of forced entry. If there are no signs of forced entry found, then the guard service will
    contact the monitoring station and prepare a report. If signs of forced entry are found, the
    guard service will remain at the property and contact the monitoring station so that a Police
    unit can be dispatched to the location. This procedure does not apply to panic, robbery,
    duress or other types of hold-up alarms. Police units will continue to respond to the panic
    types of alarms as usual. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Protect America, Inc. has negotiated a special rate with a local alarm response company for
    this required service. For this required service FIVE DOLLARS ($5.00) per month will be added
    to the monitoring rate listed on your monitoring agreement. Any additional responses over one
    (1) on-site response per year will be billed to you at FIFTY-FIVE DOLLARS ($55.00) per
    response. The alarm response company requires an additional $13.75 per quarter hour if their
    responder is detained more than twenty minutes on site. You will be invoiced this fee each
    occurrence. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The fees stated in this Addendum are subject to change, and the local verified Response
    Company may charge fees for additional services. If the local  verified Response Company
    increases its fees or charges additional fees, then you agree to pay such increase and/or
    additional fees upon written notice from Protect America, Inc. You are responsible for all
    costs or fees imposed by the guard service or private response company. 
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    PROTECT AMERICA SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER  FOR OR ARISING OUT OF THE GUARD SERVICE OR
    PRIVATE RESPONSE COMPANY OR FOR THE FAILURE TO COMPLY IN ANY WAY WITH THE STATUES OR
    ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF BELLINGHAM. 
  </strong></p>

  <p>
    Your Monitoring Agreement with Protect America, Inc. states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Some municipalities require a third party, other than police or sheriff's department, to
    respond to alarm activations. It is the responsibility of the Customer to obtain third party
    response where required and pay for any costs associated with third party services.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The City of Bellingham also requires alarm users to file an Alarm Permit. There is no charge
    for this, however you may be charged by the city for not having an Alarm Permit on file
