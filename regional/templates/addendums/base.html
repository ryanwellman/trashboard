    <h2>Addendum to Monitoring Agreement</h2>

    <p>
        As you may or may not know the {% block city %}{% endblock %} Police Department requires
        private, third party, on-site alarm verification of all home security burglar alarm
        activations before the department will dispatch a unit to the location. You are obligated
        to comply with this policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under the terms of the policy change, when a home security burglar alarm is activated,
        the monitoring station must first call a third-party, contracted, guard service to be
        dispatched to the alarm location. The guard service will be required to check the
        perimeter of the property, and look for signs of forced entry. If there are no signs
        of forced entry found, then the guard service will contact the monitoring station, and
        prepare a report. If signs of forced entry are found, the guard service will maintain
        the perimeter of the property and contact the monitoring station so that a Police unit
        can be dispatched to the location. This procedure does not apply to panic alarms.
        Police units will continue to respond to panic alarms as usual.
    </p>

    <p>
